# Database Migrations

This directory contains SQL migration files for the Stellar App OS database.

- `019_create_farmer_kyc.sql` - Stores farmer KYC applications: identity verification, land ownership proof, agricultural experience, and certification eligibility screening (#1397)
- `020_create_sponsor_email_campaigns.sql` - Stores segmented newsletter campaigns and delivery attempts (#1117), plus digest-generation indexes (#1110)
- `025_create_carbon_methodologies.sql` - Stores the carbon methodology library (Verra/CDM/Gold Standard/IPCC methodology summaries in 5 categories); seeded by `pnpm seed:methodologies` (see `docs/carbon-methodologies.md`)

## Running Migrations

### Automated Migration Runner

The automated migration runner (`scripts/run-migrations.mjs`) will:

1. Check which migrations have already been applied (via `schema_migrations` table)
2. Calculate SHA256 checksums of migration files
3. Verify that applied migrations haven't been modified (checksum validation)
4. Apply pending migrations in order
5. Track execution time for each migration

### Commands

```bash
# Run all pending migrations
npm run db:migrate

# Check migration status (which are applied/pending)
npm run db:migrate:status

# Validate migration files (syntax check, no DB connection required)
npm run db:migrate:validate

# Seed species catalogue (after running migrations)
npm run seed:species

# Seed carbon methodology library (after running migrations)
npm run seed:methodologies
```

### Environment Variables

The migration runner requires `DATABASE_URL` to be set:

```bash
# Example DATABASE_URL format
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database
```

## Adding New Migrations

1. Create a new SQL file in this directory with the next sequential number
2. Name it descriptively, e.g., `007_add_new_feature.sql`
3. Write your SQL migration (use `IF NOT EXISTS` where appropriate)
4. Run `npm run db:migrate` to apply it

## Rollback

Rollback scripts are named with `-rollback.sql` suffix. These are not automatically run by the migration runner and must be executed manually if needed.

## Safety Features

- **Checksum validation**: Prevents running migrations if files have been modified after being applied
- **Transactional**: Each migration runs in a transaction; failures are rolled back
- **Idempotent**: Migrations use `IF NOT EXISTS` to be safe to re-run
- **Execution tracking**: Records when each migration ran and how long it took
