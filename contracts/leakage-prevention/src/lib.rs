#![no_std]

//! Leakage prevention — permanent sequestration (issue #1344).
//!
//! Afforestation credits only keep their value if the trees stay standing.
//! This contract locks a 30-year permanence commitment per project: the
//! project owner either posts a token **bond** or registers an **insurance
//! guarantee** (a policy id from the carbon-insurance contract, #1412) that
//! covers the project's carbon value.
//!
//! While the commitment is active:
//! - an enrolled verifier attests periodic monitoring checks (audit trail),
//! - anyone can report a leakage event (harvesting / crop failure). A
//!   reported bond-backed commitment enters a short dispute window in which
//!   the verifier can clear the report with an attestation if it is wrong.
//! - the admin confirms a disputed leakage event, which slashes the whole
//!   bond to the treasury so the destroyed carbon value is compensated.
//!
//! Once 30 years have elapsed with no confirmed leakage the owner calls
//! `claim_completion` and the bond is returned in full — permanent
//! sequestration is proven by the passage of time plus the attestation
//! trail, and anything else is paid for out of the bond.
//!
//! ## Guarantees
//! - `PERMANENCE_TERM_SECS` is a hard-coded 30-year term; commitments exist
//!   only for `AFFORESTATION` project types.
//! - A bond can only ever move to its owner (`claim_completion`) or to the
//!   treasury (`confirm_breach`) — never to a third party.
//! - Insurance-backed commitments transfer no funds here; the insurance
//!   contract (#1412) pays the guarantee, and this contract only records the
//!   policy reference and its breach state.

// Soroban contract entry points must take `Env` (and the addresses they
// authorize) by value: the contract macro materializes arguments from the
// invocation, so `clippy::needless_pass_by_value` cannot be satisfied here
// without breaking the contract ABI.
